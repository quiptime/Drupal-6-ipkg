"SEO" Checklist Module
------------------------

**Description:
The "SEO" Checklist Module provides a list of good SEO actions that you should take to maximize the presence of your website in the major search engines. It provides little functionality itself but rather it helps you keep track of what needs to be done.

**Benefits:

Search Engines Drive 90% of the traffic on the web. The more "findable" you are, the easier it is for you to get customers. This module helps you with on-page SEO - a necessary component of a good online marketing campaign.

**To install:
1. Place the entire seo_checklist folder into your sites/all/modules directory.
2. Go to admin/build/modules and enable the 'SEO' Checklist module.

**To use this module:
1. Go to administer -> Site configuration -> "SEO" Checklist. 
2. Start with the top item "Check for already installed modules." This will look for modules that are on the checklist that you have already installed on your site. 
3. Now, go through each checkbox that is not checked and install that module or do the task.

**Optional: Volacci spent about 100 hours in research and development on this module. We want to maintain it and keep good SEO advice available to the entire Drupal community. Instead of asking for donations or bounties for this module, we request that you include a simple link back to us somewhere on your website. When you're done (or before) go down to "Link to Volacci" and check it off. That will automatically add a link on your website's footer to Volacci. If you want to link to us but not in the footer, uncheck that box and put your link where you want it. Thanks for the link! If you will email us and tell us where the link is then we'll link back to you: seochecklist [at]volacci.com. (Links help move your site up in the search engines.)

This module is potentially controversial as many people have ideas about good and bad SEO. If you have an idea of a module or task that should be included, please email us at seochecklist [at] volacci.com.

Enjoy!
