<div id="first-time"><h1 class="title">Welcome to your new Drupal website!</h1>
If you are new to Drupal, follow these steps to set up your web site in minutes:

<strong>Step 1. Check conditions</strong>

Check the permissions of the directories and files are used with "Drupal 6 ipkg". You must check the owner and group. These must be configured so that web applications like Drupal have write permission. Without proper permissions, you can (with Drupal) make no changes to the installed themes and modules.

Directories to check:

sites/all/modules/contrib
sites/all/modules/own
sites/all/themes

Simple test:

Compare owner and group of the file <q>install.php</q> with those directories and files in it.

<strong>Step 2. Start at the beginning</strong>

Visit the <a href="[[admin]]">administration section</a> for a task-based or <a href="[[admin/by-module]]">module-based</a> overview of the options available to configure your website.</li>

<strong>Step 3. Activate functionality</strong>

Turn on added functionality for your site - blogs, forums, polls, tags, comments, ratings, and more. Drupal comes with <a href="[[admin/build/modules]]">many modules</a> to power social publishing capabilities on your site.

Hundreds of additional Drupal 6.x compatible modules are available on Drupal.org in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules" target="_blank">Drupal modules download section</a>.

<strong>Step 4. Start publishing content</strong>

Start <a href="[[node/add]]">creating content</a> for your site. Depending on which modules you have activated, you may see blogs, forums, polls and more as available content types.

Some optional configuration tasks are shown below. For more information, please refer to the built-in <a href="[[admin/help]]">help section</a>, or the <a href="http://drupal.org/handbooks" target="_blank">online Drupal handbooks</a>.

<strong>Choose a different design</strong>

Start by <a href="[[admin/build/themes/settings/garland]]">changing the colors</a> of the default theme.  To change the fundamental "look and feel" of your website, visit the <a href="[[admin/build/themes]]">themes section</a> and choose a theme from one of the many themes available out-of-the-box.

Many additional Drupal 6.x compatible themes are available on Drupal.org in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes" target="_blank">Drupal themes download section</a>.

<strong>Configure the front page</strong>

The default front page is a listing of all content marked as <q>Promoted to front page</q>.  You can manage your content from the <a href="[[admin/content/node]]">content administration page</a>. You can also designate, for example, an item of content you have created as the front page. See the <a href="[[admin/settings/site-information]]">site information settings page</a> to configure the default front page path.  You can also add a slogan and mission statement to make the site your own.
